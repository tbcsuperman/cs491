            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                I have a niche hobby in game development, gone are the days of my aspirations of becoming a full-time game developer.
                Instead, I am focusing on one game that I have always wanted to build.
                One of my interests is in train simulators, so I am working on a train simulator based on the NYC subway.
                I aspire to create the entire NYC subway as a train simulator.
                The NYC subway is one of the biggest subway systems in the world, with 26 lines and 472 stations.
                I am currently only about 10% done.
